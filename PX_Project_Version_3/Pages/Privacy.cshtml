                    Our Hackathons are held every 4 months and runs over a course of 2 days which allows group of programmers to work together on a
                    collaborative project. Our hackathons tend to follow certain themes and allows teams to win prizes in different categories.
                    Participating in hackathons can prove a good way to network, learn in a team environment,
                    and generally get some experience working under pressure.

                <h5>Does my project have to follow the theme?</h5>
                <p>
                    It is not necessary that the project follows the theme of the event, however, that minimises the chance of winning a prize in that category.
                </p>

                <h5>How many people per team?</h5>
                <p>
                    Typically there are up to 2-4 people per team in which consists of one team leader.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>What are the different prizes?</h5>
                <p>
                    There are two different catergories where you can place first, second, or third. The first category is where judges vote on which project follows the theme best.
                    The second category is peoples choice where users vote on which project they liked most (following theme not necessary).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Who are the judges?</h5>
                <p>
                    For each Hackathon, few users will be selected to be a judge for that certain event.
